Color Pipeline
==============

Maintaining your color pipeline is extremely important.
As an overview, the color pipeline keeps your colors correctly identified at every step.

.. important::

    Your camera footage should look *vibrant*. 
    If it doesn't, there is a break in your color pipeline between the camera and display.


An unbroken color pipeline means accounting for each of these changes at every step. 
Generally, if your footage looks washed out, too dark, or otherwise bad you likely have a break in your color pipeline.

.. warning::

    LUTs cannot undo a broken color pipeline, no matter how hard you try.

A deep dive on color is beyond This article's current scope.
All you need to keep in mind is that any time you move footage from  one step to the next,
the color pipeline is involved.
For every workflow we discuss, we should consider how to maintain the color pipeline.
