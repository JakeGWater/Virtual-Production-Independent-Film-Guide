The VPIFG intends to be a technical reference for virtual production for smaller independent studios and individuals.
Primarily using [UnrealEngine]_, but extensible enough to accommodate as many production workflows as necessary.

Organization
============

The guide organized as follows:

* :goto:`workflows` are recipes for Virtual Production. They work, and they are used by others. If you're not sure where to start, take a look at some existing workflows.
* :goto:`theory` explains how we evaluate and compare workflows. Not all workflows are created equal.
* :goto:`guides` are the ingredients of workflows. Guides break down a topic or task into detailed steps. A single guide might be shared by multiple workflows.
* :goto:`studios` are reference examples of actual studio set up with a list of their equipment used. This should help others price estimate what a particular set up is going to cost, as well as valid weather a particular piece of equipment has been field tested.
* :goto:`help` is a collection of helpful tips and solutions to problems we have encountered along the journey.
* :goto:`references` are external links to other handy resources, tutorials, guides etc.
