While independent productions are our focus,
our aim is towards professional content that is sellable.
As such, we will frequently reference the following standards:

.. glossary::

    Production Ready
        Production Ready content should meet broadcast standards, and for lack of a better term be *sellable*. 
        More simply, production ready content must maintain its :doc:`/fundamentals/color/pipeline` and preserve :doc:`/fundamentals/timecode`.

    Timecode Integrity
        Timecode integrity requires all hardware and software that consumes or produces media to maintain the original timecode both on import and export.
        
        See more in :doc:`/fundamentals/timecode`.

    Color Pipeline
        Your color pipeline is what transforms color spaces correctly between pieces of hardware and software.

        See more in :doc:`/fundamentals/color/pipeline`.
