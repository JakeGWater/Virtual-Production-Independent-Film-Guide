Overview
========

We recommend recording to Blackmagic Raw because they work really well with Davinci Resolve.

Settings
========

* Record:

  * CODEC AND QUALITY:
  
    * **Blackmagic RAW**
    * **Constant Quality**
    * **Q0**
      The bit-rate of Constant Quality files varries, but BRaw Cosntant bitrate files with 3:1 compression use about 6 GB/minute according to [BRawDocs]_.
    
  * Resolution: Either of the following 
  
    * Choose **4K DCI** ``4096x2160`` if your intended output is *film*.
    * Choose **Ultra HD** ``3840x2160`` if your intended output is *TV*. This resolution matches the aspect ratio of 1080p, and will work a little better with your live preview.

  * Dynamic Range: **Film**. 
    You want to record at the largest dynamic range possible.

  * Project Frame Rate: 
  
    * Choose **24fps** if your intended output is *film*.
    * Choose **23.97** if your intended output is *TV*.

  * Apply LUT in File: **Off**

.. important::
    
    **Never Apply LUT In File** this will crush your dynamic range, and give you very little room to work with the footage in post.

* ISO

  * The BMPCC has two native ISOs.

        When the ISO setting is between 100 and 1,000 the native ISO of 400 is used as a
        reference point. The ISO range between 1,250 and 25,600 uses the native ISO of
        3,200 as a reference. If you are shooting in conditions where you have a choice
        between ISO 1,000 or 1,250, we suggest closing down one stop on your lensâ€™ iris so
        that you can select ISO 1,250 as it will engage the higher native ISO and provide much
        cleaner results.

    * We typically use 400 and leave it at that.
