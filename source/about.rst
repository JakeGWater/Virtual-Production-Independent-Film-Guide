Hi I'm Jake.
I make software for a living, and I love remixing technologies to produce new an interesting things.
After seeing [UnrealEngine]_ do real time VFX I was immediately hooked on the idea.
I absolutely love the idea of real, immediate, interactive worlds to explore as a filmmaker.
I jumped in feet-first, building up a home studio for virtual production with a few friends and colleagues.

Our dream for virtual production to enable anyone to produce great content, from anywhere.
This is mostly a journal of our process, but I hope it will be useful to others.
