Hi I'm Jake.
I make software for a living, but film and video have always been a passion.
A while back I started building a home virtual production studio with some friends.
The world of VFX has always appealed to me, and with [UnrealEngine]_, [Blender]_ and other free software the virtual world of filmmaking has never felt more accessible.
I absolutely love the idea of real, immediate, interactive worlds to explore as a filmmaker.

I started recording some of our progress on YouTube, with as much technical detail as possible.
At a certain point, around when our Google slide deck reached 100 slides, we realized a website was a better way to organize our learnings.

Our dream for virtual production to enable anyone to produce great content, from anywhere.
We intend to document whatever progress we make, but the site is flexible enough that anyone can contribute.

Happy filming.
