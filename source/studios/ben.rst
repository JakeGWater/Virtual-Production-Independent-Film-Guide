Green Screen

This is a WIP section, I will update more when I get some pictures of the different setups.

My greenscreen is this `green sheet <https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07J9TFGLV/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1>`_. To hold it up I have a series of 1 inch PVC with different connectors to provide different screen arrangements and sizes. I will be posting those soon.
