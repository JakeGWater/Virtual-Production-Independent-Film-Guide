Colors is a complex topic,
and no matter what we write here there will be more to know.

As it matters to Virtual Production,
we are going to focus on **Technical Color Management**,
also knows as your **Color Pipeline**.

There are two parts:

#. :doc:`aces/theory` is a high-level framework for understanding how all the pieces fit together.
#. :doc:`aces/reference` is a loosely organized collection of important details.

ACES is one implementation of color management, and while there are other approaches, we recommend using ACES.
For a `Workflow </workflows>`_ to check (âœ…) the *ACES* box, it must use ACES as its color pipeline,
and apply color management at all steps.

    :class: warning

    Color Management is different from Artistic Color Grading,
    where directors and colorists adjust colors for storytelling purposes.
