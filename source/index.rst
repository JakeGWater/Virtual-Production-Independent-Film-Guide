The VPIFG is our technical reference for virtual production for smaller independent studios and individuals.
We primarily revolve around using Enreal Engine, but the guide is extensible enough that we can accommodate other production workflows as necessary.

Organization
============

The guide is split into an easy to reference organization.

* :doc:`workflows` are specific combinations of tools and methods for producing your content. If you're not sure where to start, take a look at some existing workflows.
* :doc:`fundamentals` are the basic building blocks of virtual production. It is assumed that people familiarize themselves with the fundamentals. Other content will frequently reference fundamentals.
* :doc:`guides` are individual articles about using a particular tool in a particular way. Workflows should reference guides whenever possible. In fact a workflow might be seen as a series of guides.
* :doc:`studios` are reference examples of actual studio set up with a list of their equipment used. This should help others price estimate what a particular set up is going to cost, as well as valid weather a particular piece of equipment has been field tested.
* :doc:`resources` are external links to other handy resources, tutorials, guides etc.
