The VPIFG is our technical reference for virtual production for smaller independent studios and individuals.
We primarily revolve around using Unreal Engine, but the guide is extensible enough that we can accommodate other production workflows as necessary.

Organization
============

The guide is split into an easy-to-reference organization.

* :doc:`workflows` are virtual production recipes. They work, and they are used by others. If you're not sure where to start, take a look at some existing workflows.
* :doc:`fundamentals` are the basic building blocks of virtual production. 
* :doc:`guides` if workflows are recipes, the guides are the ingredients. Guides break down a topic or task into detailed steps.
* :doc:`studios` are reference examples of actual studio set up with a list of their equipment used. This should help others price estimate what a particular set up is going to cost, as well as valid weather a particular piece of equipment has been field tested.
* :doc:`resources` are external links to other handy resources, tutorials, guides etc.
