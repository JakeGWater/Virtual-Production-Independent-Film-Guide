=============================
Contributor License Agreement
=============================

The CLA full text is here https://gist.github.com/JakeGWater/80087b416dcf23f07f98ddf73fd47301

tl;dr
=====

* You will be asked to sign the CLA via GitHub when submitting a pull-request.
* The CLA need only be signed once, which covers all future contributions.
* The CLA allows us to modify our license without needing to get signoff from every contributor.
  Locking into a license this early might prove frustrating later on. We want to be flexible.
* You still own your contributions, and can do whatever you like with them. The combined works is governed by our :goto:`about/LICENSE`. 
* Embedded and linked content is not part of the CLA. For example, if you embed a slide presentation that content is not covered by the CLA.
  Only content committed to the repository is covered.

Unowned
=======

If you do not own the content you are contributing,
for example if you are copying content from another project with a permissive license,
that content needs to be identified:

Unowned content is *not* governed by this sites license,
but by its original license.

#. For images or files, the file paths relative to ``sources`` must be listed in :goto:`about/licenses`.
#. For content added into a document, licensed passages must be marked with::

    .. license:: TYPE
        :source: NAME OF PROJECT
        :source_url: LINK TO PROJECT

        LICENSED CONTENT HERE

This will display the content with an inlnie notice, for example:

.. license:: MIT
    :source: The Example Project
    :source_url: https://example.com
    
    This content is from the example project
